                <p style="background-color:rgb(250, 252, 253);">Sending a physical letter to request account deletion is a more powerful method compared
                     to submitting disputes online. The Affirmation Credit letter generator is a useful tool 
                     that assists in crafting compelling disputes in accordance with consumer protection regulations, 
                     increasing the likelihood of successfully having accounts removed permanently.</p>

                <p style="background-color: rgb(250, 252, 253);">Each month, Affirmation Credit Repair meticulously reviews and imports your updated credit report from 
                    all three major bureaus, providing a comprehensive overview of any accounts that have been successfully removed. In addition, the platform also displays 
                    your most recent credit scores, allowing you to track your progress over time. Should any accounts remain unchanged, Affirmation Credit offers tailored advice 
                    on alternative dispute strategies to help further improve your credit standing.</p>
