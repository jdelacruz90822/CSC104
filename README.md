For my final assignment I have created a web page called "Affirmation Credit Repair" for Credit repair/building  
This first page is my "Home page" where I talk about the company and how we help build or repair credit. This HTML filed is named "Affirmation_credit_repair.html and the CSS file used in for my HTML is called "Final_CSS.css"

The second page is a page where you can sign up and fill out your demographics so we can register you as a new customer and you can select which plan you're interested in. The HTML file I used "sign_up.html" and the CSS I used is Signup_signin.css"

My third page is a contact us page where you fill out your first and last name along with your email and we will reach you with further details, in regard to your inquiry. 
The HTML file I used for this last page description is "Faq_check.html" with the CSS file named "Contact_us.css"
